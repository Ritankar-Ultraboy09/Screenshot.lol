# Prerequisite 
1. Python 3.5 or above

# Installation 
 * Installation of the ss.exe file is a bit difficult. After you Install it , Windows will stop you from using it. It may show you this - "Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented   an unrecognized app from starting. Running this app might put your PC at risk." And trust me it is completly false.. 
  Due to this reason, the code for the particular application has also been attached in the repository , So that you may just copy it and paste it in the PYTHON IDE or Code         Editor.

 * If you just want the Screenshot application without getting warned, then simply follow the steps:-
   - After you download the (.exe)file, Right click on the file(.exe).
   - Select the properties option.
   - Click on checkbox to check Unblock at the bottom of Properties. It must be in the bottom of the properties window.
   - And then Again run the Application.
  
# Appearance 
 * A black screen will apaear and within a span of 2-3 sec, it will click a screenshot

**Saving method**

 * Now, in order to avoid a hochpoch regarding the Filename with which it will be saved, You have to mannually save the Screenshots. Just press Ctrl+S.
 * The Screenshot app can be run as many times as you want ,not simultanously, but one after one.

**Final Words**
 * It is my First ever project that I posted on Github, Hope you like it
